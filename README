Ganttify is (will be) a jQuery plugin that generates gantt charts

The goals for this project include but are not limited to
- Ability to load items via XHR
- Ability to load items via callbacks
- Ability to load items via constructor (DONE)
- Ability to parse XML and JSON at minimum
- Backwards compatibility with older browsers
- As screen size get's smaller, hide date/completion/etc columns
- Make the header optional
- When width of gantt root container get's too small, start hiding columns
- User can specify the order they want columns hidden
- Pan via mouse drag
- Allow hide/show columns at runtime
- Only re-draw/update what changed
- User defined callbacks for:
  - Items with no title (DONE)
	- Items with no description (DONE)
- Zoom via mouse scroll
- Keyboard zoom/pan/expand/collapse
- Ability to re-order items in the gantt chart
- Look good :D
- Be fast!

Questions:
- Think about how to calculate the epoch's when days/start/end/etc are missing from an item
- Perhaps we just omit items with erronous/missing properties (start, end, days)
- Which number of days do we use, the one we calculate, or the user specified one?
- Should we even rely on a "number of days" property?
	It would allow for a start date and offset resulting in less network traffic
	Would allow for an end date and negative offset resulting in less network traffic
- Do we even calculate the number of days if a user specified one exists?
- If we find our # days don't match user specified, what do we do?
	User definable callback?
	Omit item altogether?
	Use our number of days?
